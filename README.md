# 161-adopt-a-pet

To run the code, activate your virtual environment and make sure to have flask installed.
  - My computer could only do these tasks by using Git Bash or the Bash terminal in VS Code.
  - Through Bash, create your virtual environment and use "source bin/activate" to activate the terminal.
  - Use "pip install flask" in your activated environment for you to be able to run the code.
  - Make sure to have the "data.py" file in the app folder before running the app.
  - Finally type in "python app.py" to run the Adopt-A-Pet application.
